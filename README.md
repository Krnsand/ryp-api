# **Rate Your Plants API**

This is a social media platform for plant lovers! One can create an account, post pictures of their favorite plants with information about them as well as rate them in order of difficulty to care for. A signed in user can also save other users posts in order to keep a sort of “wish list” of plants.

This project is the final of 5 projects that need to be completed to receive a diploma in Fullstack Software Development from The Code Institute.

- Django Rest Framework

### **Libraries, Frameworks, and Programs**

- Cloudinary Storage
- Django rest auth
- PostgreSQL

## **Bugs**
### **Unresolved**

- As I used the very helpful Code Institute walkthrough as a guide and had fellow students' posts on the Slack forum, any issue I came across was quickly resolved. And nothing major to report or that still exists.

## **Project Setup**

* Create a new repository using the Code Institute template repository.
* Run the command pip3 install 'django<4' in the terminal to install Django.
* Run the command django-admin startproject my_api . in the terminal.
* Run the command pip install django-cloudinary-storage in the terminal to install Cloudinary Storage.
* Run the command pip install Pillow - this library adds the image processing capabilities we need for this project.
* Once these dependencies are installed we need to add them to the "Installed apps" section in settings.py.
    * Note the placement and terms used for this input into installed apps:

        ```
        'cloudinary_storage',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'cloudinary',
        ```

* Create an env.py file in the top directory.
    * Inside the env.py file, import the os module and set up the os.environ with the Cloudinary URL you can retrieve from the account you've set up.
* In the settings.py file, set up a variable called "CLOUDINARY_STORAGE" and use the environment variable used to set up in the env.py file to declare this value.
* Next, define the setting called "MEDIA_URL" and set it to "/media/" so the settings know where to store our image files.
* Finally, define a variable called "DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE" and set it to "MediaCloudinaryStorage".


## **Deployment**

The first step of deployment is setting up the JWT tokens:
* First install the package in the terminal window, using the command: 
    
    *pip install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9*
* In the settings.py file add the following to the "Installed Apps" section.

    *'rest_framework.authtoken',*

    *'dj_rest_auth',*

* Next, add the following URLs to the urlpatterns list:

    *path('dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls')),*

* In the command terminal, migrate the database just added by typing:

    *python manage.py migrate*

* Next we want to add the feature to enable the registration of users. Type the following into the terminal:

    *pip install 'dj-rest-auth[with_social]'*

* Add the following to the "Installed Apps" section in the settings.py file:

    ```
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'dj_rest_auth.registration',
    ```

* Add SITE_ID value, which is placed under INSTALLED APPS List:

    *SITE_ID = 1*


* Next add the registration URLs to the urlpatterns list, as follows:

    *path('dj-rest-auth/registration/',* 

    *include('dj_rest_auth.registration.urls')),*

* Now add JWT tokens functionality: 
    * Install the djangorestframework-simplejwt package by typing the following into the terminal command window:

        *pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt==4.7.2*

* In the env.py file, create a session authentication value (differentiates between Dev and Prod mode):

    *os.environ['DEV'] = '1'*

* In the settings.py file, use the Dev value above to differentiate between Dev and Prod Modes & add pagination which is placed under SITE_ID:

    ```REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [( 
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication' 
        if 'DEV' in os.environ 
        else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
    )]
    }
    ```
* To enable token authentication, put the following under the above step:

    *REST_USE_JWT = True*

* To ensure tokens are sent over HTTPS only, add the following:

    *JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'*

* Next, declare cookie names for the access and refresh tokens by adding:
    ```
    JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
    JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
    ```

* Create a new serializers.py file in the api folder. Then import the following files at the top of the new serializers file:

    *from dj_rest_auth.serializers*

    *import UserDetailsSerializer*

    *from rest_framework import serializers*

* Next create the profile_id and profile_image fields:
    ```
    class CurrentUserSerializer(UserDetailsSerializer):
        profile_id = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.id')
        profile_image = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.image.url')
        class Meta(UserDetailsSerializer.Meta):
            fields = UserDetailsSerializer.Meta.fields + ('profile_id', 'profile_image')
    ```


* Overwrite the default USER_DETAILS_SERIALIZER - Place below the JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token':

    *REST_AUTH_SERIALIZERS = {'USER_DETAILS_SERIALIZER': 'drf_api.serializers.CurrentUserSerializer'}*

* Next, in the terminal command window:

    *1: Run migrations*

        python manage.py migrate

    *2: Update the requirements text file:*
        
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

    *3: git add, commit and push.*


### **Adding the root route:**
* Create a views.py file in the API folder. Set up the imports in the views.py file:

    *from rest_framework.decorators import api_view*

    *from rest_framework.response import Response*

* Create root route and return custom message:

    ```
    @api_view()
    def root_route(request):
        return Response({"message": "Welcome to my API!"})
    ```
* In the urls.py file, import:

    *from .views import root_route*

* Add the URL to urlpatterns list:

    ```
    urlpatterns = [
    path('', root_route)
    ]
    ```

### **Adding JSON Renderer**

* In the settings.py file, add Pagination:

    ```
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    ...,
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':  'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
    }
    ```

### **Adding Pagination**

* In the settings.py file, set JSON Renderer if Dev environment is not present. Placed below, but separate from, the REST_FRAMEWORK list:

    ```
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    ...
    }

    if 'DEV' not in os.environ:
        REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES'] = [
            'restframework.renderers.JSONRenderer'
        ]
    ```

### **Date and time formatting - General Formatting:**

* In the settings.py file, format the Date and time in REST_FRAMEWORK list:

    ```
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    ...
    'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d %b %Y'
    }
    ```

### **Date and time formatting - Comments and Post:**

* In the reply app, create the serializers.py app. Then set the imports up in the file:
    
    *from django.contrib.humanize.templatetags.humanize import naturaltime*

* Set fields within the ReplySerializer class:

    *created_at = serializers.SerializerMethodField()*

    *updated_at = serializers.SerializerMethodField()*

* Set methods, which are placed underneath fields:

    ```
    def get_created_at(self, obj):
        return naturaltime(obj.created_at)
    
    def get_updated_at(self, obj):
        return naturaltime(obj.updated_at)
    ```
* Next add, commit, and push the new additions.

### **Create Heroku App with Heroku PostGres**

* Log into Heroku, and create a new app. (The name must be unique)

* Log in to your ElephantSQL account, and click "create new instance".

* Set up your plan:
    * Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)
    * Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
    * You can leave the Tags field blank


* Click “Select Region”, then click “Review” and then click "Create instance".

* Go back to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.

* Copy your ElephantSQL database URL using the Copy icon. It will start with postgres://

### **In heroku.com**

* Open your App in Heroku, go to the settings tab, and click "Reveal config vars".

* Add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL: The value should be the ElephantSQL database URL.

### **Install and configure extra libraries and connect to your database:**

* Install dj_database_url by typing in the command terminal window:

    *pip install dj_database_url*

* In the settings.py file, import the following:

    *import dj_database_url*

* Separate the Dev and Prod Environments, as follows:

    ```
    DATABASES = {
    'default': ({
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    } if 'DEV' in os.environ else dj_database_url.parse(
        os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    ))
    }
    ```

* Next, install gunicorn. By typing in the command terminal:

    *pip install gunicorn*

* Create Procfile (noting the capital "P"). Inside the file add:
    
    *release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate*

    *web: gunicorn drf_api.wsgi*

* In the settings.py, set the "ALLOWED_HOSTS" to:

    *['<YOURAPPNAME>.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']*

* In the command terminal, install CORS, by typing:
    *pip install django-cors-headers*

* Then add to "INSTALLED_APPS" section in settings.py:

    ``` 
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'dj_rest_auth.registration',
    'corsheaders',

    'profiles',
    ...
    ]
    ```
* Add to MIDDLEWARE  list: (place at the top of the MIDDLEWARE list)

    ```
    MIDDLEWARE = [
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
    ...
    ]
    ```

* Set the ALLOWED_ORIGINS for the network requests made to the server: (placed under MIDDLEWARE_LIST)

    ```
    if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:
        CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
            os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')
    ]
    else:
        CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
            r"^https://.*\.gitpod\.io$",
    ]

    ```

* Allow Cookies and allow front end app and API be deployed to different platforms:

    *CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True*
    *JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'*

* Set the remaining env variables:

    *os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'CreateRandomValue'*

* In the settings.py file - replace the ‘insecure’ key with the environment variable:

    *SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')*

* Replace the DEBUG Setting to be only true in Dev and False in Prod Modes:

    *DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ*

* In Heroku - Add your config vars i.e. copy and paste values from env.py into Heroku Config Vars, and add the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC var:

    *CLOUDINARY_URL, SECRET_KEY*

    *DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1*

* Back in GitHub in the command terminal - Update the requirements file, then add, commit and push the changes.

    *pip freeze > requirements.txt*

### **Final steps**

* Back in Heroku in the deploy tab: Select the Deployment Method (GitHub), select the project repository name from Github, and connect. Next in the Manual deploy section, choose the Master Branch, then click Deploy Branch.

* Once complete, click "Open App" to view.
